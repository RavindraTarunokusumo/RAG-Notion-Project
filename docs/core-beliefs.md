# Core beliefs (golden principles)



1) Mechanical enforcement beats repeated review comments.

2) Prefer boring, composable tech that agents can reason about.

3) No YOLO data probing: boundaries must be validated or typed.

4) Make changes legible: small PRs, tests, structured logs, explicit decisions.

5) If a rule repeats twice in review, promote it into a linter/CI check.
